# winman
Window switching shortcut tool

A tool for assigning windows to hotkeys on the fly. 

Inspired by Command & Conquer teams. Number your favourite windows (ctrl + super + number) and jump between them easily (super + number).

No support offered. This is a personal tool, probably with very little appeal to others. Just use a tiling WM!
